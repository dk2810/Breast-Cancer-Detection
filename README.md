# Breast-Cancer-Detection
Main.ipynb file contains all the main code for this project. Open that if you wish to read the code.

The data utilized for this project has been imported from sci-kit learn library directly, so you won't find a data file for this project and won't require to install any discretely.

I have added a CSV file from which I have used some lines as an input to the model so that the model can detect whether the cancer is benign or malignant.
